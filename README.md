# Predicting-taffic-speed-based-on-graph-neural-networks

I have spent one and a half year doing research in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) with Dr. David Lattanzi. He instructs me to find a novel way do the research. 
This project is mainly about how to use graph neural network to predict traffic speed based on the influence of roadway maintenance. The code also includes data mining infrastructure and data processing.

# Data

I have spent nearly 60% of time learning the knowledge of deep learning approaches and exploring the data from INRIX and Virginia Department of Transportation. This project is funded by VDOT, which is required to do an analysis of how does workzone impact the traffic area in a region.
I provided two datasets, one is Tyson's Corner made by myself, and the other is Los-loop dataset.
  1. Tyson's Corner:
    131 road sensors
    Jan.1t to Dec.30 in 2019
    Traffic speed during the construction work period
    The matrix of construction work
    5 mins time-interval
    
  2. Los-loop:
    207 road sensors
    Mar.1t o Mar.7,2012
    Traffic speed
    5 mins time-interval

For all the information, you can read my master thesis here. Currently it is a draft thesis, but after a few days. You will see the Final version.
