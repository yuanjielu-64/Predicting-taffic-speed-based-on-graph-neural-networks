# Predicting-taffic-speed-based-on-graph-neural-networks

I have spent one and a half year doing research in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). 
This project is mainly about how to use graph neural network to predict traffic speed based on the influence of roadway maintenance. It also includes data mining infrastructure and data processing.

For all the information, you can read my master thesis here.
